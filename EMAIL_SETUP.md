# Email Integration Setup Guide

## Current Implementation
The hire form currently uses a `mailto:` link approach that opens the user's default email client with all form data pre-filled. This is reliable and works across all devices without requiring external services.

## Option 1: EmailJS Integration (Recommended for Direct Email Sending)

To enable direct email sending from the form without opening the user's email client, you can set up EmailJS:

### Steps:
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account
2. Create a new Email Service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create an Email Template with the following variables:
   - `{{from_name}}`
   - `{{from_email}}`
   - `{{company}}`
   - `{{phone}}`
   - `{{project_title}}`
   - `{{project_type}}`
   - `{{budget}}`
   - `{{timeline}}`
   - `{{team_size}}`
   - `{{services}}`
   - `{{project_description}}`
   - `{{additional_requirements}}`
   - `{{submission_date}}`

4. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key from EmailJS dashboard

5. Update the `handleSubmit` function in `/src/pages/Hire.tsx`:
   - Replace `'service_your_service_id'` with your actual Service ID
   - Replace `'template_your_template_id'` with your actual Template ID  
   - Replace `'your_public_key'` with your actual Public Key

6. Uncomment the EmailJS implementation and comment out the mailto approach

### Benefits:
- Direct email sending without opening email client
- Professional email templates
- Email delivery tracking
- No user interaction required

## Option 2: Backend API Integration

For more control and professional email handling:

1. Create a backend API endpoint (Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Use services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Nodemailer
3. Update the form to POST data to your API endpoint
4. Handle email sending server-side

## Current Setup Benefits

The current mailto approach has several advantages:
- ✅ Works immediately without additional setup
- ✅ No external dependencies or API keys required  
- ✅ Universal compatibility across all devices and email clients
- ✅ User sees exactly what will be sent
- ✅ User maintains control over the email sending process
- ✅ No risk of emails being blocked by spam filters

## Form Features Implemented

- ✅ Controlled form inputs with state management
- ✅ Form validation (required fields)
- ✅ Service selection with visual feedback
- ✅ Loading state during submission
- ✅ Form reset after successful submission
- ✅ Professional email formatting
- ✅ All form data included in email body
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

## Testing the Form

1. Navigate to `/hire` page
2. Fill out the form fields
3. Select desired services
4. Click "Submit Project Request"
5. Your default email client will open with the email pre-filled
6. Send the email to complete the process

The form automatically formats all the information into a professional email format that will be sent to `mohit8052231582@gmail.com`.
